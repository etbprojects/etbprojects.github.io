### [Simplification of the Gaussian Integral](/assets/pdfs/First_Project___Simplication_of_the_Gaussian_Integral.pdf)  
*By Joseph Yazuardi*

This paper presents a personal exploration of the Gaussian integral and its polar coordinate transformation. Written independently as an undergraduate, it walks through a full derivation and concludes with a graphical visualization of the bell curve. It was also Josephâ€™s first project using LaTeX.

### [Pendulum Motion: Numerical Methods and Analysis](/assets/pdfs/Pendulum%20Motion.pdf)  
*By Carl Somera*

This paper explores the motion of a pendulum using Newtonian mechanics and numerical methods, specifically the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) algorithm. It compares results from small-angle approximations with full nonlinear numerical solutions, and even includes damping analysis for air resistance models.

### [String Theory Textbook](/assets/pdfs/String Theory Textbook v0.1.pdf)
*By Carl Somera*
String theory textbook that will cover both bosonic and superstring theory. It is meant to provide a rigrous yet easy to understand introduction to the subject at a graduate level.
