## Welcome to ETB Projects! 👋 🔭 📚

ETB Projects is a STEM-focused collaborative project shaped by our shared passion for knowledge. Our topics range from string theory to solid-state physics, and this site serves as a living archive of our academic and professional development. We primarily focus on theoretical and applied physics, including a range of simulations and hands-on tools.

This initiative was co-founded by Joseph Yazuardi and Carl Somera, both undergraduate physics majors with a shared interest in interdisciplinary learning.

We also include a book review section. While not always STEM-specific, these reviews help keep our minds active and engaged. We believe that exploring a wide range of ideas sharpens our thinking across disciplines.

Additionally, this site hosts updates from the business project [JW Analytics Cikarang & Co.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jw-analytics-cikarang-co), which showcases 3D model development using SketchUp. Led by Joseph Yazuardi in the role of Project Engineer, the initiative focuses on architectural and real estate planning in Indonesia, with an emphasis on applying data analytics for design and process optimization.
