## Welcome to ETB Projects! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ”­ðŸ“š
ETB Projects is a STEM-focused collaborative project shaped by our shared passion for knowledge. Our topics range from string theory to solid-state physics, and this site serves as a living documentation of our academic and professional progress. We primarily focus on theoretical and applied physics, including a range of simulations and hands-on tools.

In addition, we include a book review section. These may not always be STEM-specific, but they help keep our minds active and engaged. We believe that exploring a wide range of ideas strengthens our thinking across disciplines.

This site also serves as a platform for the business project [JW Analytics Cikarang & Co.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jw-analytics-cikarang-co), which showcases the development of 3D design models built using SketchUp. The project is led by Joseph Y. and focuses on architectural and real estate planning in Indonesia, with a mission to apply data analytics for design and process optimization.
