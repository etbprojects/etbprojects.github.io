### Welcome to ETB Projects

ETB Projects is a STEM-focused space shaped by our personal curiosity. Our topics range from string theory to solid-state physics, and this site serves as a living archive of our learning journey. Everything here reflects our genuine passion for the material and a desire to share our progress as we grow.

In addition to simulations and hands-on tools, we include book reviews. These may not always be STEM-specific, but they help keep our minds active and engaged. We believe that exploring a wide range of ideas strengthens our thinking across disciplines.

We're also experimenting with visual tools like SketchUp to help bring ideas to life. These models and visual mockups are featured on separate pages and serve as part of our creative development process.

This site also ties into our business project, **JWAC**, which applies our engineering mindset and design skills in real-world contexts. ETB Projects functions as both a creative outlet and a sandbox for the knowledge we apply through JWAC.
